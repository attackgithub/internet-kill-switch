# internet-kill-switch
The idea came about for this project because some VPN services do not have a built-in killswitch. It's kind of pointless for a VPN to automatically default to the unencrypted netwrok connection when the connection times out or closes for some reason.

This project is designed for Windows 7+ and using .net 4.0.
